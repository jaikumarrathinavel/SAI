Rational
--------
Modern chips has distributed architecture where HW resources are split between 
ingress and egress stages of the pipleine for scaling and performance reasons.

PR#1482 introduces a method to specify the stage of a resource in a backward 
compatible way.

Common Data Type
-----------------
New data type sai_object_stage_t is introduced. This data type specifies if a 
resource is of type

- SAI_OBJECT_STAGE_BOTH: 
  Resource is a common shared resource between ingress and egress SAI pipeline

- SAI_OBJECT_STAGE_INGRESS: 
  Resource belongs to ingress stage of SAI pipeline

- SAI_OBJECT_STAGE_EGRESS: 
  Resource belongs to egress stage of SAI pipeline


HOSTIF Trap
-----------
A new read only hostif trap attribute is introduced. NOS can query this 
attribute to find out if a given HW supports this trap as an 
ingress/egress/both trap.
- SAI_HOSTIF_TRAP_ATTR_OBJECT_STAGE:
  Read only attribute that specifies the HW implementation of the trap stage.

- SAI_HOTIF_TRAP_GROUP_ATTR_OBJECT_STAGE:
  CREATE_ONLY attribute to configure a trap group of type stage
  ingress/egress/both


Policer Pool
------------
A new CREATE_ONLY policer attribute is introduced. NOS can set this attribute
to specify the stage of the pool.
- SAI_POLICER_ATTR_STAGE:
  CREATE_ONLY attribute that specifies the stage of the policer pool.
  Default is kept as SAI_STAGE_BOTH common pool for backward compatibility.

Sample Existing Workflow:
------------------
1. create_hostif_trap_group()

2. create_hostif_trap(): By default this trap is created in 
   SAI_SWITCH_ATTR_DEFAULT_TRAP_GROUP trap group. 
or

2. create_hostif_trap() for trap group created in step 1. 

3. create_policer()

4. Attach policer to the trap using set of SAI_HOSTIF_TRAP_GROUP_ATTR_POLICER 
   attribute.

Sample New Workflow for stage specific hostif trap and policer pool:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1a. create_hostif_trap_group() for ingress stage
1b. create_hostif_trap_group() for egress stage
1c. create_hostif_trap_group() for both stage

2a. create_hostif_trap(): By default this trap is created in 
    SAI_SWITCH_ATTR_DEFAULT_TRAP_GROUP trap group. 
2b. Read SAI_HOSTIF_TRAP_ATTR_STAGE to find out HW implementation

3. Set the trap group for the trap based on the trap stage. Trap may get 
   1a/1b/ac as the trap group binding based on the trap stage.

3. create_policer() for ingress/egress/both stage.

4. Attach matching stage policer to the trap using set 
   SAI_HOSTIF_TRAP_GROUP_ATTR_POLICER 

NOS Validataion:
----------------
NOS MUST ensure that trap group consist traps of type ingress, egress, or 
both only base on the trap group object stage.

If NOS creates a trap group with mix of trap stages then SAI adapter MUST 
return the error as SAI_STATUS_STAGE_MISMATCH

SAI_STATUS_STAGE_MISMTACH: New error code is is introduced to handle incorrect
                           configuration.
